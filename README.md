# MusicalDRV8825
This software was written to make a stepper motor play a song by modulating the step frequency.

The sample ino file was written to recreate "Row Row Row Your Boat" as accurately as possible.

The software is written as an Arduino library.

The features listed below are included in the repository:

Plays single notes from the fourth octave's chromatic scale.
Plays complete songs composed of any combination of the 12 supported notes.
Handles fractional notes (e.g. half, quarter, eighth notes)
Adjustable tempo variable
